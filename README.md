# IS218Final

Note to Professor Nissen:

This was literally all I was physically able to do for the project. Between taking three heavily project-based classes this semester,
I was left with virtually no time to even focus on creating something that was actually decent for the project.

I really only wanted a B/C+ for this class after I was starting to become unable to finish the last couple of assignments due to heavy
time constraints. Sadly, I've just been burned out after heavy stress and not enough relief. I recognize this as my own fault,
and I'll let you judge my grade accordingly. Thanks for your time, and have a good summer.
